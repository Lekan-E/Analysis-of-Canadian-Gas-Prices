## Introduction
The years 2016 and 2022 were pivotal in the cost of gas across self-service filling stations in all provinces. In 2016, gas prices were at their lowest due to low global demand, while 2022 saw the highest prices as the economy recovered from the global pandemic. As a new graduate looking to purchase a car and open to relocation, two critical questions arise: "Which province should I settle in to save on fuel costs?" and "What time of the year is best to buy a car with respect to gas prices?"

The aim of this project is to analyze the cost of gas across Canadian provinces over the past 10 years, using key metrics to make informed, data-driven decisions. I will focus mainly on using Data Visualization techniques.

## Data
For our analysis, I will be using data collected by the Government of Canada and provided on Statistics Canada in a .csv format. This contains historical data on a month-to-month basis for the last 10 years. It was a raw file, so we had to clean and prepare the data for analysis. 

## Methodology
### Flowchart
- Data Source & Collection: Statistics Canada
- Data Cleaning (Python and Tableau Prep): Drop not needed columns, Join individual tables
- Data Exploration & Extraction: Extract the fuel type from plain text, Assign province codes/abbreviation
- Results/Visualizations: Using Tableau, Choropleth Maps, Box Plots, Line and Bar Charts

## North Start Metrics
- Regional Price Variations: Differences in fuel prices across various Canadian provinces.
- Average Cost: Monthly average retail fuel price at self-service filling stations in each Canadian province.
- Year-over-Year Change: Percentage change in fuel prices compared to the same period in the previous year.
- Seasonal Variation: Fluctuations in fuel prices during different seasons of the year (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer).

## Summary of Insights
### Regional Price Variation:
- Alberta has the lowest fuel costs, making it the most economical choice for those looking to save on fuel expenses. Manitoba and Saskatchewan also offer favorable options for cost-conscious individuals.
- Yukon, British Columbia, and Northwest Territories have the highest fuel prices, making them less ideal for those looking to minimize fuel expenses.

### Average Cost Trends:
- From 2014 to 2015, gas prices significantly declined across all fuel types, likely due to an oversupply of crude oil and weakening demand. From 2016 onwards, prices began to recover gradually, with diesel showing a particularly strong rebound. 
- The sharp rise in prices observed between 2021 and 2024 can be attributed to increased demand as economies reopened post-pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and market volatility.

### Year-over-Year Changes:
- 2014-2015: Significant drop in prices for all fuel types, with regular gas experiencing the steepest decline.
- 2015-2020: Gradual price recovery, with diesel showing a stronger recovery, surpassing unleaded gas around 2018.
- 2020-2021: A noticeable dip, especially for diesel, indicating high volatility due to market disruptions.
- 2021-2024: Sharp rise in prices for all fuel types, reaching new peaks by 2024.

### Seasonal Variation:
- Gas prices are lowest in the winter months and rise significantly in the summer, peaking in June and July. This suggests higher demand for gasoline during the summer due to increased travel and driving. Reduced driving in winter likely contributes to lower prices.

## Recommendations
- To save on the cost of fuel, Alberta emerges as the most practical and economical choice for settlement. With consistently low fuel prices, resilience against global market volatility, and advantageous local supply conditions, Alberta offers significant savings on fuel expenditures. For those who prioritize low living costs, particularly in fuel expenses, Alberta, followed by Manitoba and Saskatchewan, are recommended as the best provinces for settling.
- By purchasing a car in the winter months, particularly between December and February, you can take advantage of the seasonal low in gas prices. This strategy will help you reduce the initial fuel costs associated with buying a new vehicle and maintain lower operating expenses in the early stages of ownership.
- The best time to buy a car, with respect to gas prices, is during the winter months when fuel costs are generally lower. Pair this with settling in regions like Alberta, Manitoba, or Saskatchewan for overall fuel savings.
