# The Evolution of Canadian Gas Prices through the Last Decade
A Report by Olamilekan Razak Elegbede

## Introduction
### Background
I came across an article highlighting the current cost of buying and maintaining a car. But what caught my attention was the emphasis on how the cost of fueling a car has rapidly increased in the last year or two. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, at some point Canadians paid less than a dollar per liter for gas and comparing that to today’s price at $1.50 on average is absurd. This made me curious to perform a research analysis on the evolution of gas prices in Canada in the last decade across all provinces. <br/>

### Problem Statement
In the last 10 years, the cost of gas has fluctuated based on various events, such as the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic which is currently affecting the cost today, the carbon-tax bill in British Columbia and many more events. The aim of this project is study Canada gasoline prices across all provinces, determining how much on average each province spends on the 
various types of gasoline, looking at the major events through the last decade and identifying the highest and lowest cost. A further analysis I aim to perform is studying the 4 seasons in a year and how it affects the price of gas. Lastly build an interactive dashboard for users to monitor price changes over time. I will focus mainly on using Data Visualization techniques. <br/>

### Basis
There are several factors affecting the cost of gasoline prices in the last 10 years in Canada. For this project, I performed by analysis using the following criteria:
* Different type of fuel – Diesel Fuel, Regular Unleaded Fuel and Premium Unleaded Fuel
* Proximity/Distance from Oil Reserves
* Supply and Demand

## Data
For our analysis, I will be using data collected by the Government of Canada and provided on Statistics Canada in a .csv format. This contains historical data on a month-to-month basis for the last 10 years. It was a raw file, so we had to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Determine the Prices for each Province
In this section, the goal was to determine the average price of gasoline in the last decade in each province across Canada. The visualizations below show the rising average cost of each gas types. This gives us an overview on which province pays the most for gas and in turn which saves the most.
